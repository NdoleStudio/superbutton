          By using the SuperButton service, these terms will automatically apply
          to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully
          before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app,
          any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed
          to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also
          shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make
          derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks,
          copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights
          related to it, still belong to Ndole Studio.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ndole Studio is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and
          efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make
          changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for
          any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services
          without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
        </p>
        <p>
          SuperButton app stores and processes personal data that you have
          provided to us, to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to
          keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend
          that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
          removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official
          operating system of your device.

          SuperButton does use third-party services that declare their Terms and
          Conditions. Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service

        <p>
          You should be aware that there are certain things that Ndole Studio
          will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will
          require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection
          can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Ndole
          Studio cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
          functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have
          any of your data allowance left.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
          remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network
          provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
          mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
          connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In
          using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges,
          including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home
          territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.
          If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the
          app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission
          from the bill payer for using the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the same lines, Ndole Studio cannot always take responsibility
          for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your
          device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it
          on to avail the Service, Ndole Studio cannot accept responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to Ndole Studio’s responsibility for your use of the app,
          when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that
          although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all
          times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so
          that we can make it available to you. Ndole Studio accepts no
          liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result
          of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
          available on Android – the requirements for the system(and for any
          additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to)
          may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to
          keep using the app. Ndole Studio does not promise that it will always
          update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the
          Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you
          promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to
          you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use
          of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless
          we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and
          licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop
          using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
