# SuperButton

Communicate with your customers using their preferred channels. Capture more leads on your website using a configurable open source floating widget. You don't need to know how to code and it is free.

### Why?

Some of your website visitors like contact forms while others prefer to chat directly using whatsapp or email, some prefer phone calls, and some prefer to read your documentation. Support every customer using their favorite channel.

### Quick Start

I created a blog post with a quick start guide. See it here ðŸ‘‰ https://superbutton.app/blog/configurable-action-button
